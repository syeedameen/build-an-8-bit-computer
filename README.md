# Build an 8-bit Computer

This is an online book about building an 8-bit computer from scratch, iteratively expanding on it's features from the very basics to a fully fledged \(and hopefully usable\) computer.

An online book version is available at [https://tobier.gitbook.io/build-an-8-bit-computer/](https://tobier.gitbook.io/build-an-8-bit-computer/). It is generated using [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/).

This project is fully **open source** and **open hardware**. All source code and schematics are available in the [Github repository](https://github.com/tobier/build-an-8-bit-computer), as well as the sources for the book.

**Contributions** are welcome and encouraged. If you find a problem, don't hesitate to [submit an issue](https://github.com/tobier/build-an-8-bit-computer/issues). If you want to contribute, please fork the repository and submit a [pull request](https://github.com/tobier/build-an-8-bit-computer/pulls).
